<h2><strong>Pre-history of south korea</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Pre-history of South Korea, also known as the Korean Peninsula, is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic era, the Neolithic era, and the Bronze Age.

</ul>
<ol>
    <li><strong>The Paleolithic era</strong></li>
    <p><em>During the Paleolithic era, which began around 500,000 BCE, the Korean Peninsula was inhabited by hominids who lived in caves and relied on hunting and gathering for survival. Many Paleolithic-era artifacts, including stone tools and pottery, have been discovered throughout the region.

    </em></p>
    <li><strong>The Neolithic era</strong></li>
    <p><em>The Neolithic era, which began around 8,000 BCE, saw the emergence of agriculture and the domestication of animals. The people of the Korean Peninsula began to cultivate crops such as rice, millet, and barley, and to raise livestock such as pigs and cattle. They also developed pottery, weaving, and metalworking skills.</em></p>
<li><strong>The Bronze Age</strong></li>
<p><em>The Bronze Age, which began around 1,000 BCE, saw the development of complex societies and the emergence of early states. The Korean Peninsula was divided into many small kingdoms, each with its own ruling elite, social hierarchy, and religious practices. During this period, bronze weapons and tools were introduced, and elaborate burial customs emerged.
